## Data
 
All data used in this manuscript is publicly available. Here are links on how to download or access each data set: 

* [FlowSorted.Blood.450k](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/FlowSorted.Blood.450k.html). R/Bioconductor data package containing Illumina HumanMethylation data on sorted blood cell populations. 
* [GSE95163](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95163). This dataset from [Carmona et al. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41525-017-0012-9) measured whole blood samples on two platform technologies: (1) Illumina 450k microarray platform and (2) reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) platform. The whole blood samples were derived from ten male individuals resulting in $N$ = 12 microarray samples and $N$=12 RRBS samples. 
* [GSE42861](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE42861). This dataset from [Liu et al. (2013)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334450) studied methylation differences between rheumatoid arthritis patients and normal controls. Here, we only considered the normal controls. 
* [GSE77716](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE77716). This dataset is used in [Rahmani et al. (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27018579). This is the Gala II dataset, describing a pediatric latino population with $N$ = 573 whole blood samples processed on the Illumina 450K microarray platform. There are also $N$ = 95 (out of the 573) samples that were processed to obtain cell counts using FACS (processed 4 months later).
